# Quality Gates and Validation Framework

This document defines the quality gates, validation criteria, and approval processes that ensure high-quality deliverables throughout the Multi-Agent Software Development Orchestration Framework.

## Quality Gate Philosophy

Quality gates serve as checkpoints that prevent defects from propagating through the development pipeline. Each gate has specific entry criteria, validation procedures, and exit criteria that must be satisfied before proceeding to the next phase.
