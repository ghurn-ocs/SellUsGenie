# Deployment Process and Production Management

This document defines the deployment procedures, production management protocols, and post-deployment monitoring for the Multi-Agent Software Development Orchestration Framework.

## Deployment Philosophy

Deployments are treated as the final validation of the entire development process. Every deployment must be safe, reversible, and monitored. The GitHub Master agent coordinates all deployment activities while ensuring zero-downtime releases and immediate rollback capabilities.

## Deployment Execution

### Branch Management
**Git Flow Implementation:**
```bash
# Feature branch merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/ai-risk-prioritization --no-ff
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "AI Risk Prioritization Engine"
git push origin main --tags
```

### Database Migrations
**Supabase Migration Process:**
1. **Staging Validation**: Execute migrations in staging environment
2. **Production Backup**: Create full database backup
3. **Migration Execution**: Run migrations during maintenance window
4. **Verification**: Validate schema changes and data integrity
5. **Performance Check**: Ensure no performance degradation

```sql
-- Example migration execution log
BEGIN;
-- Execute migration scripts
-- Validate data integrity
-- Check performance impact
COMMIT;
```

### Frontend Deployment
**Build and Deploy Process:**
1. **Asset Optimization**: Minify and compress all frontend assets
2. **CDN Upload**: Deploy optimized assets to CDN
3. **Cache Invalidation**: Clear CDN caches for updated files
4. **Service Worker Update**: Update service worker for offline functionality
5. **Performance Validation**: Verify load times and responsiveness

```bash
# Frontend deployment script
npm run build
npm run optimize-assets
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://cybersecvault-assets --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id XXXXX --paths "/*"
```

### Backend Deployment
**API Service Deployment:**
1. **Zero-Downtime Strategy**: Blue-green deployment approach
2. **Health Check Validation**: Ensure new instance healthy before routing traffic
3. **Database Connection**: Verify database connectivity
4. **External Service Integration**: Test Auth0, Stripe, and GCP AI connections
5. **Load Balancer Update**: Route traffic to new instance

```bash
# Backend deployment script
# Build and test new instance
npm run build
npm run test
# Deploy to new instance
pm2 start server.js --name "api-v1.2.0"
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Update load balancer routing
```

### AI Service Deployment (if applicable)
**AI Model and Service Deployment:**
1. **Model Validation**: Verify model files and dependencies
2. **API Endpoint Testing**: Test AI service endpoints
3. **Performance Validation**: Confirm response times meet requirements
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Enable AI-specific monitoring and alerting
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to subset of users initially

```python
# AI service deployment validation
import requests
import time

# Test AI endpoint
response = requests.post('/api/ai/risk/calculate', json={
    'vulnerabilityId': 'test-vuln-001'
})
assert response.status_code == 200
assert response.json()['success'] == True
```

npm run deploy-emergency
# Verify health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

#### Database Rollback (if required)
