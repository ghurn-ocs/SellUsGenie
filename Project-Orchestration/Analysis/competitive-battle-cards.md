## Universal Objection Handling

### 💬 **"You're a new vendor - we need proven solutions"**
**Response**: "New doesn't mean unproven. We're built by security veterans who learned from the limitations of legacy tools. Our customers achieve 90% better results precisely because we're not constrained by 20-year-old architecture."

### 💬 **"Your platform seems too good to be true"**
**Response**: "The difference is AI-first architecture. Legacy vendors are retrofitting AI onto old platforms. We built intelligence into every component from day one. That's why we can deliver results they can't."

### 💬 **"We already have multiple security tools"**
**Response**: "Tool sprawl is exactly the problem. You're paying for 5 tools, 3 integrations, and 2 FTEs just to manage them. We deliver better results with one platform, one vendor relationship, and lower total cost."

### 💬 **"What about support and professional services?"**
**Response**: "Our intelligent platform requires 70% less configuration than legacy tools. Most customers are productive in 2-4 weeks vs. 6-12 months. We focus on outcome-driven support, not billable hours."
