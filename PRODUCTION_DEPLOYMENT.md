### **Step 2: Upload Files**
1. **Clear existing files** (if updating)
   - Delete all files in your domain's root directory
   - Keep any `.well-known/` folders for SSL certificates

2. **Upload production files**
   - Upload ALL contents of the `dist/` folder to your domain root
   - Ensure `.htaccess` file is uploaded and visible
   - Verify folder structure matches the dist layout

- ✅ `.htaccess` (server config)
- ✅ `robots.txt` (SEO)
- ✅ `sitemap.xml` (search engines)
- ✅ `assets/` folder with all JS/CSS files

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

Create `.env.production` with your production values:

```bash
# Supabase (Production)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-production-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key

# Stripe (Production - LIVE keys)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_stripe_key

# Application URLs
VITE_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
VITE_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/api
```

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

Test these essential features after deployment:
1. **Homepage Loading** → https://yourdomain.com
2. **Authentication Flow** → Google/Apple OAuth
3. **Store Creation** → Dashboard functionality
4. **Page Builder** → https://yourdomain.com/page-builder.html
5. **Responsive Design** → Mobile/tablet testing

## 📞 Troubleshooting
