# SellUsGenie - Project Planning

**Last Updated:** August 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - MVP Development (Months 1-4)  
**Project Status:** Active Development  

## Current Sprint Focus

### Sprint Goal
Complete core multi-store authentication and data isolation architecture to enable secure multi-tenant operations.

### Sprint Priorities
1. **HIGH**: Finalize multi-tenant database architecture with RLS policies
2. **HIGH**: Complete OAuth authentication flow (Google/Apple)
3. **MEDIUM**: Store creation and switching functionality
4. **MEDIUM**: Basic product management system
5. **LOW**: Initial page builder framework

## Active Development Areas

### ðŸ”¥ Critical Path Items
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation (Row Level Security policies)
- [ ] Authentication system hardening
- [ ] Store creation wizard
- [ ] Basic e-commerce cart functionality

### ðŸš€ Next Up (Upcoming Sprint)
- [ ] Payment integration with Stripe
- [ ] Page builder drag-and-drop interface
- [ ] Product image upload and management
- [ ] Delivery area mapping system

### ðŸŽ¯ Upcoming Milestones
- **Month 1 End**: Foundation complete (Auth + Multi-store architecture)
- **Month 2 End**: Core e-commerce functionality (Products + Cart + Checkout)
- **Month 3 End**: Page builder system with templates
- **Month 4 End**: MVP launch ready

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Active Issues
- [ ] Google Maps delivery area selection infinite loop (RESOLVED âœ…)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation errors in analytics components
- [ ] Performance optimization needed for large product catalogs

### Dependencies
- [ ] Google Maps API key configuration
- [ ] Stripe webhook endpoint setup
- [ ] Email service provider selection and setup
- [ ] CDN configuration for image optimization

## Architecture Decisions

### Recent Decisions
- âœ… **Multi-tenancy**: Row Level Security (RLS) approach chosen over schema separation
- âœ… **State Management**: TanStack Query + React Context over Redux
- âœ… **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for accessibility
- âœ… **Backend**: Supabase over custom Node.js backend

### Pending Decisions
- [ ] Email service provider (SendGrid vs Resend vs Supabase Functions)
- [ ] Image CDN strategy (Supabase Storage vs Cloudinary)
- [ ] Analytics platform integration approach
- [ ] Mobile app strategy (PWA vs React Native)

## Risk Monitoring

### Current Risks
- **Technical**: Supabase scaling limitations as user base grows
- **Business**: Competition from Shopify's multi-store features
- **Timeline**: Page builder complexity may delay MVP launch

### Mitigation Actions
- [ ] Evaluate Supabase scaling options and backup plans
- [ ] Conduct competitive analysis update monthly
- [ ] Simplify page builder MVP scope if needed

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Current Status
- **Stores Created**: 0 (target: 100 by month 2)
- **User Registrations**: 0 (target: 500 by month 2)  
- **Core Features Complete**: 35% (target: 60% by month 2)
- **Test Coverage**: 45% (target: 80% by month 3)

## Team Reminders

### Development Standards
- All features must work on mobile devices
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) compliance required
- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- Multi-tenant data isolation must be verified for each feature

### Quality Gates
- All features require automated tests
- Performance budget: < 3s initial page load
- Security review required for auth-related changes
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
